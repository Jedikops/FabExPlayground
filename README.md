## Requirements & Installation
With the removal of support for pages loaded via **file://** URLs in v2.0.1, working with Fabric Explorer requires a web server.  FabEx Playground is preconfigured to work with node.  Therefore, you must:


1. Have node and npm installed
2. Unzip the deployment file (FabExPlayground.zip) and copy the files to a directory on your hard drive
3. Open a command prompt in that directory
4. Run **npm install** to download pre-requisites
5. Run **gulp** (no parameters) to launch the web server and open the FabEx Playground page inside Chrome.
6. Open the Chrome Dev Tools by hitting **F12**
7. Click on the **Elements** Tab
8. Click on the **Fabric Explorer** tab
